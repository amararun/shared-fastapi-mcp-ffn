  title: Security Performance Review (SPR) API
  description: |
    A professional FastAPI-based portfolio analysis API that uses Security Performance Review (SPR) methodology combining custom calculations with FFN (Financial Functions) library metrics. This API provides comprehensive quantitative portfolio analytics with beautiful HTML reports, multiple CSV data exports, and MCP integration for AI agents.
    
    The API connects Yahoo Finance data with SPR custom calculations and FFN analytics to deliver in-depth performance analysis of multiple securities simultaneously. Analysis includes core performance metrics using custom calculations (Total Return, CAGR, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio), risk analysis via FFN (maximum drawdown, volatility), visual charts, monthly returns breakdown via FFN, and drawdown analysis.
    
    Generated reports include professional HTML reports with REX AI branding, interactive charts, and multiple CSV files for data analysis. Core metrics use custom implementations based on QuantStats methodology while additional analytics leverage the open-source FFN library.

                    Comma-separated Yahoo Finance ticker symbols for SPR portfolio analysis (e.g., 'AAPL,MSFT,GOOG').
                    Supports multiple securities simultaneously using SPR methodology. Use standard market symbols like 'AAPL' for Apple, 'MSFT' for Microsoft.
                    For indices, use '^' prefix (e.g., '^GSPC' for S&P 500). Can analyze individual stocks, ETFs, indices, and mixed portfolios.
                  example: "AAPL,MSFT,GOOG"

                    Should provide sufficient history for meaningful SPR analysis (recommended minimum 1 year).
                    Historical data availability depends on Yahoo Finance database, typically going back decades for major securities.

                    SPR analysis end date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
                    Must be after start_date. The SPR analysis includes this date in results.
                    Can use current date for up-to-date analysis.
